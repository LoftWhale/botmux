 * Legacy pm2 reaper — a one-shot, self-contained cleanup for machines UPGRADING
 * from a pm2-based botmux to the built-in supervisor. botmux used to run its
 * multi-bot fleet under a dedicated pm2 God daemon (PM2_HOME=~/.botmux/pm2).
 * After the migration nothing spawns pm2, but an upgrading host may still have a
 * live pm2 God holding the OLD botmux daemon processes — which would double-run
 * alongside the new supervisor's daemons. `botmux start`/`restart` calls this to
 * detect that stale God and stop it, so the operator never has to `pm2 kill`
 * by hand (the chosen migration UX: auto-detect-and-stop, not just warn).
 *
 * SELF-CONTAINED by design: it does NOT import any of the removed pm2-* guard
 * modules. When a pm2 CLI is reachable it drives pm2 directly; when it is NOT
 * (the compiled single binary bundles no pm2, and a source install may have none
 * on PATH) it falls back to the God's own `pids/` records and signals those
 * processes itself. Either way it is FAIL-SAFE — a fresh install with no legacy
 * God no-ops entirely — but it never reports success it cannot back up: see
 * `unresolved` on the result.

 * daemons for ~15 hours with NO pm2.pid in its PM2_HOME (only rpc.sock/pub.sock,
 * pids/, and the logs). pm2 writes that file at daemon launch and removes it on
 * shutdown, so a God whose file was cleaned up, rotated away, or never written by
 * an older pm2 is invisible to a pid-file-only probe.
 *
 * That miss is not benign: the reaper exists so `botmux start/restart` can stop a
 * pre-migration God before the new supervisor starts its OWN daemons. A silent
 * no-op here means both fleets run at once — every bot doubled, two processes
 * answering the same Feishu events.
 *
 * So fall back to the God's RPC socket, which is what the pm2 CLI itself connects
 * through. `pm2 jlist` succeeds against exactly this God with no pid file at all
 * (verified). We return pid 0 for a socket-only God: reaping drives everything
 * through the pm2 CLI (`delete`/`kill`), none of which needs the pid — it is only
 * reported for logging.
 *
 * The socket's EXISTENCE is not enough, though: `pm2 kill` removes pm2.pid but
 * leaves rpc.sock behind — MEASURED right after this reaper first stopped a real
 * fleet. An existence-only probe then reports the dead God as live on every
 * subsequent command, so `status` keeps telling the operator to run a migration
 * that already completed, and re-running it can never clear the warning. So probe
 * whether a process actually HOLDS the socket.
 *
 * The pid check goes through `isAlive`, not a bare `kill(pid, 0)`, for the same
 * reason: right after a reap the God is a ZOMBIE until its parent reaps it, and
 * `kill(pid, 0)` succeeds for a zombie — MEASURED, that alone made a
 * just-killed God read as live and put the stale warning back.
 *
 * EXPORTED because `status`/`logs` print an operator-facing "legacy pm2 still
 * running" warning off the same question. They used to answer it with their own
 * copy of this logic, which drifted: the warning outlived a successful reap. One
